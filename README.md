# Overview
A game about speed and a chain that lets you swing around any point you hit. Everything is by me and I did not follow any tutorials in the making of this. 
However, my planning skills are not at the level I want them to be, and this has resulted in a lot of technical debt over the course of two to three years.
# Instructions
To use this you need pygame and the latest Python version. Included is the game in main.py and a level editor. 
The level editor has a tile selection box that is visible while you hold TAB and whatever your mouse is hover over when you let go of TAB will be the tile you select. You can toggle the several different layers with 1, 2, 3, 4 on the keyboard. On the left would be some information boxes for placing markers that can then be interpreted by the main game as something such as an enemy or checkpoint. The main game's controls are WASD, SPACE, and Left Mouse Button.
# Plans
There were several features planned. However, as of now I plan on putting the game on hold until I get better at game architecture and have a better grasp on what direction I want the game to go as a whole. Right now the game is missing a few features that were already implemented and there will probably be some debugging/testing features fully visible. When I'm ready to come back, I will rework all of the code to be more friendly to read/work with.
