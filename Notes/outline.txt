you enter into a witch's den. inside you find just a whole with no visible way down
other than jumping. You have a grapple hook. with it you lower yourself down into
the hole. at the bottom "HEY YOU GET ME OUT OF HERE". there is a old man 
crawling on the ground. you go to help them. "can you get me out of here!?".
you tell them that you could lend your hookshot to them but that they would have
to throw it back down for yourself. "don't mind if I do" he grabs the hookshot
without you getting it out for him.(why is he crawling on the ground one second
and then then next he's ok?) "well thanks. I should warn you though; this
place is dangerous. I don't know what your doing here, but fighting is useless.
you can't fight the witch without magic". you thank them for that advice. they
lift themself up, when they got to the top they threw the hookshot down
you tried to catch it but it fell in a small cave pond. with the hook shot you are
and your agility you go deeper into the witch's cave.
