what am I doing

figuring out objects.

what are they?


mechanic place holders:
	breakable blocks, 
	interactive animated tiles,
	healing stations
	doors
	checkpoints
	spawners
	npcs
	pickups
	camera controls




	what is its structure?
pos, type, data, group, layer
(I might want it to be a rectanlge) 
(yeah they need to be hit boxes)
	How does the game use it?
when the game first loads a chunk it looks for any entities and spawns them in.

when a event happens it looks for all objects in a group with that events name
and runs a function that corresponds with it.

	How do you place it?
entering object mode
by entering text into text boxes
picking a layer
clicking on where you want to place it

basically the meat of the game mechanics need some way to be saved

WHAT ARE THE STUPID DOWNSIDES TO STORING THINGS IN A GRID?!

dont have specific hitboxes
can't easily be queried in the case of acting on all tiles

so have three different ways of storing the data?

one for if it is complety static
one for if it needs to have freedom but also unload and load
one for if it needs to be activated from off screen or in groups all at once
one for if it needs to always be active



the problem is that it's so general that it's impossible to think about all at once

the everything list will just have to be slow?

what do I want from it
I want it to be possible to have some id thats unique and for it to be able to grab the same data all the time
also I want it to be possible to just loop through it all.
