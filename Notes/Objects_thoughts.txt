way to remove tiles
way to create enemies and save if you fought them already
place chests
npcs
platforms
warp points


action groups are better suited to being loaded all the time (some other things too)

enemies are better suited to being loaded with chunks(and other interactables)

maybe combine the two because sometimes you want both data views

so how?

have a list of all the objects

have a dictionary for groups in those groups have refrences to the actual objects

and also keep refrences in the chunks
