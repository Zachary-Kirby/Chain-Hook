you start out on your homemade training ground
you try to master the chain hook that you made
you prepare to go into the mountain tomb
the mountain used to have an easy path to the tomb
but several disasters reshaped the inside and now the way in isn't as easy
this is the reason why you made your chain hook
with it you can climb paths that no person could traverse normally, but at the risk of your life.
you must travel to the treasure and get back out

the path mostly consists of ruins that have been shaped by earthquakes,
subterrainian rivers, and creatures that have moved in
