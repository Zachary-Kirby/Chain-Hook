I have a level editor, but that doesn't mean that I can easily make anything I want.
for example: what if I want to make a boss?
a boss might need several special points defined for movement,
detection areas,
graphical representation. (this is the only thing that can't be generalized easily)

what goes into a boss?

  slime boss
you pull its heart out.
the ai has a set path to follow.
it has a start point.

the slime boss would be pretty simple to add with the current all perpose level editor.

  snow giant
you climb its arms.
it shakes you off.
the giant would need a weakness. 
  Maybe I giant icecicle could drop onto its head.
  You could get it to punch itself in the face.
  you could have to trap its arms in the wall.
  you could have to break ice that it stands on to drop it into water to freeze it.
  you could have to set it on fire.

the boss could be defined with bounding boxes...

  flying dragon
it would have a course that it would have to fallow.
any detection zones could be hardcoded.
the dragon could have points that it lands at.
animation would have to be hardcoded.
maybe you steer the dragon into the ground or big stone pillars.
maybe you drop stuff on it.
maybe you aim a ballista at it.
  might need a arrow to point at where the dragon is or a minimap.
  the camera could follow the ballista arrow, and there could be a arc predicting where the arrow will go on a minimap.

the boss could probably be defined with the current level editor

I need a way to quickly switch between levels. I could stick with just changing the level in the code and reloading. (if it were c++ this would be different though)
I want copy, paste, cut, undo, and redo.
I really want smart tiles.
