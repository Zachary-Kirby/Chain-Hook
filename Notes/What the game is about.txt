what is the minimum product here?

enough content to fill 30 minutes?

enough to show that this could be a fun game.
it should also show what this game is about.

it's about the hookshot and using it to more quickly traverse areas.
maybe solving puzzles.
stealth

I've definitely have decided on theses factors:
	stealth and the hookshot.

you could use the hookshot for quicker escapes

use it for hiding

for stunning

for interacting with faraway objects

as a distraction

what are the stealth aspects?
	honestly I just want something like the stealth of metroid fusion.
		which was mostly non exsistent If I think about it.
		You mostly just saw them from a distance or were running from them.
		
	hiding in closets, rooms or other places?
	I like the aspect of keeping the alert level down in cogmind. (it's something that might need testing)
	
	
what is the perpose of the game?

enjoyment.
what kind though?
interest?
fun?
extreme emotion?
challenge?

what will you see through the door next?
what horrors will you see.
what horrors will see you.
