I need to brainstorm becuase I have no direction now.

things that I could add:

npcs

town

shop

hiding

patrols

alert level

alert level triggered events

cutscenes

pathfinding

chests

inventory

bombs

blowupable walls

keys

locked doors

switchs that are activated by the hookshot

a second hookshot

moving platforms

moving hookshotable object

floating book platforms

familiars

spring board

switchable blocks

pushable crates

flares (would increase alert level when used)

noise makers (would increase alert level when used)

electric water

moving water levels

moving lava levels

satanic rituals (performed by the witch)

the actual devil (summoned by said witch)

falling platforms

moving spikes

readable bookshelves

waterable plants that grow into fantastical sizes

paintings with ghosts in them

living walls

falling blocks (onto the players head)

sleeping statues that go beserk and all spiky when you wake them up

shovel for digging up dirt

a house with stuff you've collected

the village slowly grow back to its original glory as you save the people from the witch

the first boss you meet you convince into fighting the witch.
somebody like this is needed to make the village make more sense. it wouldn't make
sense becuase the witch could, at any moment, abduct the people again.
maybe they could be called the spell maker or the armorer.

objects that you can pull out with the hookshot

flowing water

fans that blow you

zero gravity zones

hot areas

cold areas

spells that you can get from collecting things in the castle

temporary power ups that are expensive but used to kill a monster once

a mirror that is used to talk to the armorer

a way to teleport back to the village if you're afraid?

different costumes for your character for different play styles.

killer npcs that will make you wonder if it's safe to save everybody.

shadow version of yourself

shadow version of yourself to see if you are faster then your last run.

totem pole enemy

your family?

somebody who turns the village against you.

a point where you lose your hookshot.

a point where you lose your legs.

teleport hookshot? not likely.

sanity meter.

a boat...

time traveler boss (they affect time, which you have to follow)

somebody that is somehow nuetral, and takes you to all the different areas 
that you've been to.

puzzle that involves tricking you into thinking you need two hookshots

fairy that provides some light where your cursor is.

the jester (because thats what I was listening to)



(I'm getting real shovel knight vibes)
(also I had to make a connection between shield hero and captain america)

bosses (I Don't think you really fight them. It's more like you run away and hide)
{
living fire boss

the brewer

the writer

the castle itself

the witch (I guess she is a queen rather then some country witch)
}

enemies
{

yeti

flying books that shoot spells

piano with teeth

book that sucks you into a pocket dimension

shadow piranhas
