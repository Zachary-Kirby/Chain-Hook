armorer fight.

you have to pull a curse off of him.

where is the curse located?

is it a neckless?

a crystal?

does he just need to be stunned enough times?

does he have a weapon that you need to steal from him? (yeah this one)

what is the weapon?

a chain ball

a sword

a spear

a arrow

a shield

a hammer

what if it's multiple!?!

he throws the spear

he swipes the sword

the chain ball spins around him and certain points in the room.

the sword gets stuck in the wall
what does the sword actually do?
when it gets close it charges up, then dashes at you.


he throws the chain ball at you and it has to slowly slide back at him

the spear gets stuck at the point you were at
