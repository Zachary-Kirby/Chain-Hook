BUGS

Player can swing into a corner of a block and will clip into the block

if your are holding left or right when trying to jump onto a ladder it instantly jumps off
  possible solution is to only allow the player to get off when the buttons are first pressed rather then when held
  
The hookshot can be used to be pulled through objects
when swinging with the hookshot into a ceiling the player can get stuck

when you get to the top of the ladder you should probably stop instead of falling off
